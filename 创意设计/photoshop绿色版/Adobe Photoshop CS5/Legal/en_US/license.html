<p class="c4"><b>2. Software
License.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">If you obtained the Software and any
required serial number(s) from Adobe or one of its authorized
licensees and as long as you comply with the terms of this
agreement, Adobe grants you a non-exclusive license to install and
use the Software in a manner consistent with its design and
Documentation and as further set forth below. See Section 16 for
specific provisions related to the use of certain products and
components, for example font software, Acrobat, After Effects,
Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Adobe Device Central, Flash Player,
Flash Builder, and Adobe Runtimes.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.1 Limited Use. The Software, or
portions of the Software, may allow installation and use without a
serial number. If so, you may install but not use such
non-serialized Software on any number of Computers as part of an
organizational deployment plan. Further, you may install and use
such non-serialized Software on any number of Computers for
demonstration, evaluation and training purposes only and only if
any Output Files or other materials produced through such use are
used only for internal, non-commercial <i>and</i> non-production purposes.
You may not use such non-serialized Software after any applicable
time-out period has ended, unless you input a valid serial number
under Section 2.2. ACCESS TO AND USE OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED
WITH SUCH NON-SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN
RISK.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.2 General Use. You may install and
use one copy of the Software only on the Permitted Number of your
compatible Computers into which you enter a valid serial
number.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.3 Distribution from Server. You
may copy an image of the Software onto Computer file server(s)
within your Internal Network for the purpose of downloading and
installing the Software onto Computers within the same Internal
Network for use as permitted by Section 2.1 and 2.2.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.4 Server Use. You may install the
Software on Computer file server(s) within your Internal Network
only for use of the Software initiated by an individual from a
Computer within the same Internal Network only as permitted by
Section 2.2. The total number of users (not the concurrent number
of users) able to use the Software on such Computer file server(s)
may not exceed the Permitted Number.</p><br>
<p class="c5">By way of example, the foregoing
does not permit you to install or access (either directly or
through commands, data or instructions) the Software: (a) from
or to a Computer not part of your Internal Network, (b) for
enabling Web hosted workgroups or services available to the public,
(c) by any individual or entity to use, download, copy or
otherwise benefit from the functionality of the Software unless
licensed to do so by Adobe, (d) as a component of a system,
workflow or service accessible by more than the Permitted Number of
users, or (e) for operations not initiated by an individual
user (e.g., automated server processing).</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.5 Portable or Home Computer Use.
Subject to the important restrictions set forth in Section 2.6, the
primary user of the Computer on which the Software is installed
under Section 2.2 (“Primary User”) may install a
second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on either
a portable Computer or a Computer located at his or her home,
provided that the Software on the portable or home Computer is not
used at the same time as the Software on the primary
Computer.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.6 Restrictions on Secondary Use by
Volume Licensees. If the Software was obtained under an Adobe
volume license program (currently known as Adobe Open Options) by
any licensee other than an educational volume licensee, the second
copy of the Software made under Section 2.5 must be used solely for
the benefit and business of that volume licensee. For more
information about secondary use by volume licensees, please visit
our Web Site at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/open_options">http://www.adobe.com/go/open_options</a>.
</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.7 Backup Copy. You may make a
reasonable number of backup copies of the Software, provided your
backup copies are not installed or used for other than archival
purposes.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.8 Content Files. Unless stated
otherwise in the “Read-Me” files or other
license(s) associated with the Content Files, which may include
specific rights and restrictions with respect to such materials,
you may use, display, modify, reproduce and distribute any of the
Content Files. However, you may not distribute the Content Files on
a stand-alone basis (i.e., in circumstances in which the Content
Files constitute the primary value of the product being
distributed), and you may not claim any trademark rights in the
Content Files or derivative works thereof.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.9 Sample Application Code. You may
modify the source code form of those portions of the Software
programs that are identified as sample code, sample application
code, or sample components (each, “Sample Application
Code”) in the accompanying Documentation solely for the
purposes of designing, developing and testing Web Sites and
applications developed using Adobe software programs; provided,
however, you are permitted to copy and distribute the Sample
Application Code (modified or unmodified) only if all of the
following conditions are met: (a) you distribute only the
compiled object Sample Application Code with your application;
(b) you do not include the Sample Application Code in any
product or application designed for Web Site development; and
(c) you do not use the Adobe name, logos or other Adobe
trademarks to market your application. You agree to indemnify, hold
harmless and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims
or lawsuits, including attorney’s fees, that arise or
result from the use or distribution of your application.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.10 Programming Languages. The
Software may include portions of the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK. Subject to the restrictions contained in this Section
2, Adobe grants to you a nonexclusive, nontransferable,
royalty-free license to use the items in the ExtendScript SDK and
Pixel Bender SDK only for the purpose of internal development of
application programs designed to function with Adobe products.
Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.10, no portions of
the ExtendScript SDK or the Pixel Bender may be modified or
distributed. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Adobe
from and against any loss, damage, claims or lawsuits, including
attorney’s fees, that arise or result from such
distribution. </p><br>
<p class="c5">2.11 Dual Boot Platform. The
Software is licensed for use on a specific operating system
platform. You must purchase a separate license for use of the
Software on each operating system platform. By way of example, if
you desire to install the Software on both the Mac OS and Windows
operating system platforms on a device that runs both of those
platforms (i.e., a dual boot machine), then you must first obtain
two separate licenses for the Software. This is true even if two
versions of the Software, each designed for a different operating
system platform, are delivered to you on the same media.</p><br>
<p class="c5">2.12 Documentation. You may make
copies of the Documentation for your own internal use in connection
with use of the Software in accordance with this agreement but no
more than the amount reasonably necessary. Any permitted copy of
the Documentation that you make must contain the same copyright and
other proprietary notices that appear on or in the
Documentation.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>3. Intellectual Property
Ownership.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">The Software and any authorized
copies that you make are the intellectual property of and are owned
by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The structure,
organization, and source code of the Software are the valuable
trade secrets and confidential information of Adobe Systems
Incorporated and its suppliers. The Software is protected by law,
including but not limited to the copyright laws of the United
States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions.
Except as expressly stated herein, this agreement does not grant
you any intellectual property rights in the Software and all rights
not expressly granted are reserved by Adobe and its
suppliers.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>4. Restrictions and
Requirements.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">4.1 Notices. Any permitted copy of
the Software that you make must contain the same copyright and
other proprietary notices that appear on or in the
Software.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.2 Use Obligations. You agree that
you will not use the Software other than as permitted by this
agreement and that you will not use the Software in a manner
inconsistent with its design or Documentation.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.3 No Modifications. Except as
expressly permitted in Sections 2.8, 2.9 or 16, you may not modify,
port, adapt, or translate the Software.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.4 No Reverse Engineering. You will
not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt
to discover the source code of the Software. If you are located in
the European Union, please refer to Section 16.1.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.5 No Unbundling. The Software may
include various applications, utilities, and components, may
support multiple platforms and languages, and may be provided to
you on multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the
Software is designed and provided to you as a single product to be
used as a single product on Computers as permitted by Sections 2
and 16. You are not required to install all component parts of the
Software, but you may not unbundle the component parts of the
Software for use on different Computers. You may not unbundle or
repackage the Software for distribution, transfer or resale. See
Section 16 for specific exceptions to this Section 4.5.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.6 No Transfer. YOU WILL NOT RENT,
LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN OR TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS IN THE
SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED
ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER EXCEPT
AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN. You may, however, permanently
transfer all your rights to use the Software to another individual
or legal entity provided that: (a) you also transfer
(i) this agreement, (ii) the serial number(s), the
Software affixed to media provided by Adobe or its authorized
distributor, and all other software or hardware bundled, packaged
or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, upgrades,
updates, and prior versions, and (iii) all copies of font
software converted into other formats to such individual or entity;
(b) you retain no upgrades, updates or copies, including
backups and copies stored on a Computer; and (c) the receiving
party accepts the terms and conditions of this agreement and any
other terms and conditions under which you purchased a valid
license to the Software. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU MAY NOT
TRANSFER EDUCATION, PRE-RELEASE, OR NOT FOR RESALE COPIES OF THE
SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE OBTAINED UNDER AN ADOBE VOLUME LICENSE PROGRAM
EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY ADOBE WITHIN THE TERMS OF A
VOLUME LICENSE PROGRAM. Information about obtaining the right to
transfer volume licensed software may be found at
<a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/openoption_policies">http://www.adobe.com/go/openoption_policies</a>.

party confirm in writing your compliance with this agreement,
provide Adobe with information about yourselves, and register as
end-users of the Software. Allow 4-6 weeks to transfer. Please

Department for more information.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.7 No Service Bureau. You will not
use or offer the Software on a service bureau basis.</p><br>
<p class="c5">4.8 Adobe Runtime Restrictions. You
will not use Adobe Runtimes on any non-PC device or with any

</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>5. Updates.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">If the Software is an upgrade or
update to a previous version of Adobe software, you must possess a
valid license to such previous version in order to use such upgrade
or update. After you install such update or upgrade, you may
continue to use any such previous version in accordance with its
end-user license agreement only if (a) the upgrade or update
and all previous versions are installed on the same Computer,
(b) the previous versions or copies thereof are not
transferred to another party or device unless all copies of the
update or upgrade are also transferred to such party or device, and

the upgrade or update. No other use of the previous version(s) is
permitted after installation of an update or upgrade. Upgrades and
updates may be licensed to you by Adobe with additional or
different terms.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>6. Limited
Warranty.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">Adobe warrants to the individual or
entity that first purchases a license for the Software for use
pursuant to the terms of this agreement that the Software will
perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for the
ninety (90) day period following receipt of the Software when used
on the recommended operating system and hardware configuration.
Non-substantial variation of performance from the Documentation
does not establish a warranty right. This limited warranty does not
apply to the following, which are made available AS-IS and without
warranty from Adobe: patches, font software converted into other
formats; pre-release (beta), trial, starter, evaluation, product
sampler, and not for resale (NFR) copies of the Software; Web
Sites, Adobe Online Services; Third Party Online Services;
Certified Document Services (see Section 16); and any software made
available by Adobe for free via Web download from an Adobe Web
Site. All warranty claims must be made, along with proof of
purchase, to the Adobe Customer Support Department within such
ninety (90) day period. Visit the Adobe Customer Support pages
at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/support">http://www.adobe.com/go/support</a>
for more information about warranty claims. If the
Software does not perform substantially in accordance with the
Documentation, the entire liability of Adobe and its affiliates and
your exclusive remedy will be limited to either, at
Adobe’s option, replacement of the Software or refund of
the license fee you paid for the Software. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET
FORTH IN THIS SECTION GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE
ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO
JURISDICTION. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT YOUR WARRANTY RIGHTS TO
ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. Please see Section 16 for
jurisdiction-specific provisions or contact the Adobe Customer
Support Department.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>7. Disclaimer.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 6 IS
THE ONLY WARRANTY OFFERED BY ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, AND SUPPLIERS
AND IT STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ADOBE’S,
ITS AFFILIATES’, OR SUPPLIERS’ BREACH OF THAT
OFFERED WARRANTY. THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 6 AND ANY
STATUTORY WARRANTY AND REMEDY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED
UNDER LAW ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE. OTHER
THAN THOSE OFFERED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, ADOBE,
ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES (DEFINED
BELOW) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND
TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM,

ADDITIONAL WARRANTY RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH MAY NOT BE WAIVED OR
DISCLAIMED. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT YOUR WARRANTY RIGHTS TO
ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. The provisions of Sections 7 and
Section 8 will survive the termination of this agreement, howsoever
caused, but this will not imply or create any continued right to
use the Software after termination of this
agreement. </p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>8. Limitation of

<p class="c5">EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY
OFFERED BY ADOBE ABOVE AND ANY REMEDIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR
LIMITED UNDER LAW, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS,

INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS,
ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY

ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS AFFILIATES,

THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE,

agreement limits Adobe’s liability to you in the event of
death or personal injury resulting from Adobe’s negligence
or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its
affiliates, suppliers, and Certificate Authorities for the purpose
of disclaiming, excluding, and limiting obligations, warranties,

<p class="c4"><b>10. Governing Law.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">If you are a consumer who uses the
Software for only personal non-business purposes, then this
agreement will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which
you purchased the license to use the Software. If you are not such
a consumer, this agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the substantive laws in force in: (a) the
State of California, if a license to the Software is obtained when
you are in the United States, Canada, or Mexico; or (b) Japan,
if a license to the Software is obtained when you are in Japan,

(c) England, if a license to the Software is obtained when you
are in any jurisdiction not described above. The respective courts
of Santa Clara County, California when California law applies,
Tokyo District Court in Japan, when Japanese law applies, and the
competent courts of London, England, when the law of England

excluded.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>11. General
Provisions.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">If any part of this agreement is
found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of
the balance of this agreement, which will remain valid and
enforceable according to its terms. This agreement may only be
modified in writing, signed by an authorized officer of Adobe. This
is the entire agreement between Adobe and you relating to the
Software and it supersedes any prior representations, discussions,
undertakings, communications, or advertising relating to the
Software.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>12. Notice to U.S. Government End

including, if appropriate, the provisions of Executive Order 11246,
as amended, Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment
Assistance Act of 1974 (38 USC 4212), and Section 503 of the

action clause and regulations contained in the preceding sentence
will be incorporated by reference in this agreement.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>13. Compliance with
Licenses.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">If you are a business, company, or
organization, you agree that, no more than once every 12 months,
Adobe or its authorized representative shall, upon 10
days’ prior notice to you, have the right to inspect your
records, systems, and facilities to verify that your use of any and
all Adobe software is in conformity with your valid licenses from
Adobe. For example, Adobe has the right to those of your records
useful to determine whether installations of the Software have, or
have not, been serialized, and you shall provide such records to
Adobe promptly upon request by Adobe. You may find information
about counting Software serializations at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/volume_resources">http://www.adobe.com/go/volume_resources</a>.
 If a verification discloses that your use is not in conformity
with a valid license, you shall immediately obtain valid licenses
to bring your use into conformity.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>14. Internet Connectivity and
Privacy.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">14.1 Automatic Connections to the
Internet. The Software may cause your Computer, without additional

otherwise specified in Sections 14.2 through 14.6, the following
provisions apply to all automatic Internet connections by the
Software:</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.1.1 When the Software
automatically connects to the Internet, an Internet protocol

automatically connects to the Internet, no personally identifiable
information is sent except to the extent that IP Addresses may be
considered personally identifiable in some jurisdictions;
and</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.1.3 Whenever the Software makes
an Internet connection and communicates with an Adobe Web Site,
whether automatically or due to explicit user request, the Adobe
Privacy Policy (<a target="ADB-ESG" href=

terms of use at that time, the Adobe.com Terms of Use
(<a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/terms">http://www.adobe.com/go/terms</a>)
 shall apply. Please note that the Adobe Privacy Policy allows
tracking of Web Site visits and it addresses in detail the topic of
tracking and use of cookies, Web beacons, and similar
devices.</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.2 Updating. The Software may
cause your Computer, without additional notice, automatically to
connect to the Internet (intermittently or on a regular basis) to
check for Updates that are available for download to and
installation on your Computer and to let Adobe know the results of
installation attempts. Please consult the Documentation for
information about changing update settings.</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.3 Activation. The Software may
cause your Computer, without additional notice, and on an
intermittent or regular basis, automatically to connect to the
Internet in order to validate that the Software is being operated
in accordance with this agreement (a process referred to as
“Activation”). In some cases, Software that fails
to activate may offer only limited functionality or may not operate
at all. Please visit <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/activation">http://www.adobe.com/go/activation</a>
for more details.</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.4 Use of Adobe Online Services.
The Software may cause your Computer, without additional notice,
and on an intermittent or regular basis, automatically to connect
to the Internet to facilitate your access to content and services
that are provided to you by Adobe as further described in Section
16.5. In addition, the Software may, without additional notice,
automatically connect to the Internet to update downloadable
materials from these services so as to provide immediate
availability of these services even when you are offline. Please
consult the Documentation for information about changing update
settings.</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.5 Digital Certificates. The
Software uses digital certificates to help you identify downloaded
files (e.g., applications and content) and the publishers of those
files. For example, Adobe AIR uses digital certificates to help you
identify the publisher of Adobe AIR applications and the Adobe
Acrobat family of products uses digital certificates to sign and
validate signatures within PDF documents and to validate certified
PDF documents. Your Computer may connect to the Internet at the
time of validation of a digital certificate.</p><br>
<p class="c5">14.6 Settings Manager. The Software
may include Flash Player. Flash Player may cause certain user
settings to be stored on your Computer as a local shared object.
These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to
configure certain settings within the Flash Player. You can find
more information on local shared objects at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security">http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security</a>

 </p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>15. Peer to Peer
Communications.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">The Software may use your connection
to a local area network, without additional notice, automatically
to connect to other Adobe software and, in doing so, may indicate
on the local area network that it is available for communication
with other Adobe software. These connections may transmit the IP
Address of your connection to the local network but no personally
identifiable information is ever transmitted or received through
such network connections (except to the extent that IP addresses
may be considered personally identifiable in some jurisdictions).
Please consult the Documentation for information about changing
default settings.</p><br>
<p class="c4"><b>16. Specific Provisions and
Exceptions.</b></p><br>
<p class="c5">This section sets forth specific
provisions related to certain products and components of the
Software as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and
conditions. To the extent that any provision in this section is in
conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, this
section will supersede such other term or condition.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.1 No Prejudice, European Union
Provisions.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.1.1 This agreement will not
prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those
dealing as consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who
obtain the Software for personal, domestic, or household use (not
business purposes), this agreement is subject to the Consumer
Guarantees Act.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.1.2 If you obtained the Software
in the European Union (EU), you usually reside in the EU and you
are a consumer (that is you use the Software for personal,
non-business related purposes), then Section 6 does not apply to
your purchase and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for
a period of 2 years from purchase that the Software provides the
functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the
“agreed upon functionalities”) when used on the
recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial variation from
the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty
rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE THAT YOU USE ON A
PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, OR PRODUCT SAMPLER BASIS, OR TO FONT
SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS, OR TO THE EXTENT THE
SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To
make a warranty claim, you must notify the Adobe Customer Support
Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of
purchase of the Software. Adobe will verify with you whether there
is a defect in the Software or advise you that the error arises
because you have not installed the Software correctly (in which
case, Adobe shall assist you). If there is a defect in the
Software, you may request from Adobe either a refund or a repaired
or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied
by proof of purchase. In the event your warranty details are
substantiated, Adobe will meet your request for repaired or
replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for Adobe to do
so, in which case Adobe will provide you with a refund. For
warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe Customer Support
Department.</p><br>
<p class="c5">Please note that the provisions of
Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any
damages claims you make in respect of your use of the Software.
Nonetheless, Adobe shall be liable for direct losses that are
reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach by Adobe of this
agreement. You are advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid
and reduce damages, in particular by making back-up copies of the
Software and your computer data.</p><br>
<p class="c5">This agreement, and in particular,
this Section 16.1.2, is intended to describe your rights (including
your statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with
your use of the Software. If your statutory rights are greater than
this description, your statutory rights shall apply.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.1.3 Nothing included in this
agreement (including Section 4.4) shall limit any non-waivable
right to decompile the Software that you may enjoy under applicable
law. For example, if you are located in the European Union (EU),
you may have the right upon certain conditions specified in the
applicable law to decompile the Software if it is necessary to do
so in order to achieve interoperability of the Software with
another software program, and you have first asked Adobe in writing
to provide the information necessary to achieve such operability
and Adobe has not made such information available. In addition,
such decompilation may only be performed by you or someone else
entitled to use a copy of the Software on your behalf. Adobe has
the right to impose reasonable conditions before providing such
information. Any information supplied by Adobe or obtained by you,
as permitted hereunder, may only be used by you for the purpose
described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or
used to create any software that is substantially similar to the
expression of the Software or used for any other act that infringes
the copyright of Adobe or its licensors.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.2 Pre-release Software Additional
Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software
(“Pre-release Software”), then this section
applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does
not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs,
errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures
and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release
Software. If you received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a
separate written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated
License Agreement for PreRelease Software, your use of the Software
is also governed by such agreement. You will return or destroy all
copies of Pre-release Software upon request by Adobe or upon
Adobe’s commercial release of such Software. YOUR USE OF
PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR
WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN
PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.3 Educational Software Product.
If the Software is Educational Software Product (Software
manufactured and distributed for use by only Educational End
Users), you are not entitled to use the Software unless you qualify
in your jurisdiction as an Educational End User. Please

such output device for every multiple of five represented by the
Permitted Number of Computers.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.4.3 You may take a copy of the
font(s) you have used for a particular file to a commercial printer

<p class="c5">16.4.4 You may convert the font
software into another format and install it for use in other
environments, subject to the following conditions: A Computer on

font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms
and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may
be used only for your own customary internal business or personal
use and may not be distributed or transferred for any purpose,
except in accordance with Section 4.6 of this agreement.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.4.5 You may embed copies of the
font software into your electronic documents for the purpose of

 you may also embed copies of that font software for the
additional purpose of editing your electronic documents. No other
embedding rights are implied or permitted under this
license.</p><br>
<p class="c5">16.4.6 As an exception to the above,
the fonts listed at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts">http://www.adobe.com/go/restricted_fonts</a>

software application, program, or file other than the
Software.</p><br>
