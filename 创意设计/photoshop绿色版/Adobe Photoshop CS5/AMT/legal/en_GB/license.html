License.</b></p>
<p class="c5">If you obtained the Software and any
required serial number(s) from Adobe or one of its authorized
licensees and as long as you comply with the terms of this
agreement, Adobe grants you a non-exclusive license to install and
use the Software in a manner consistent with its design and
Documentation and as further set forth below. See Section 16 for

<p class="c5">2.1 General Use. You may install and
use one copy of the Software on up to the Permitted Number of your
compatible Computers as long as, when required by the Software, you
present a valid serial number for each copy; and</p>
<p class="c5">2.2 Distribution from Server. You
may copy an image of the Software onto file server(s) within your
Internal Network for the purpose of downloading and installing the
Software onto Computers within the same Internal Network for use as

use of the Software initiated by an individual <a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_M20"
id="_DV_M20"></a>from a Computer within the
same Internal Network as permitted by Section 2.1. The total number
of users (not the concurrent number of users) <a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_M21" id=
"_DV_M21"></a>able to use the Software on
such Computer file server(s) may not exceed the Permitted
Number.<a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_C6" id="_DV_C6"></a></p>
<p class="c5">By way of example, the foregoing
does not permit you to install<a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_M22" id=
"_DV_M22"></a> or access (either directly
or through commands, data or instructions) <a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_C8" id=
"_DV_C8"></a>the Software<a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_M23"
id="_DV_M23"></a>: (i) from or to a
Computer not part of your Internal Network, (ii) for enabling web
hosted workgroups or services available to the public, (iii) by any
individual or entity to use, download, copy or otherwise benefit
from the functionality of the Software unless licensed to do so by

accessible by more than the Permitted Number of users, or (v) for
operations not initiated by an individual user (e.g., automated
server processing<a target="ADB-ESG" name="_DV_C10" id=
"_DV_C10"></a>); and</p>
<p class="c5">2.<a target="ADB-ESG" name="OLE_LINK5" id=
"OLE_LINK5"></a>4 Portable or Home Computer
Use. Subject to the important restrictions set forth in Section
2.5, the primary user of the Computer on which the Software is
installed under Section 2.1 (&ldquo;Primary User&rdquo;) may
install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use
on either a portable Computer or a Computer located at his or her
home, provided that the Software on the portable or home Computer
is not used at the same time as the Software on the primary
Computer. You may be required to contact Adobe in order to make a
second copy.</p>
<p class="c5">2.5 Restrictions on Secondary Use by
Volume Licensees. If the Software was obtained under an Adobe
volume license program (currently known as Adobe Open Options) by
any licensee other than an educational volume licensee, the second
copy of the Software made under Section 2.4 must be used solely for
the benefit and business of that volume licensee. For more
information about secondary use by volume licensees, please visit
our website at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/open_options_uk">http://www.adobe.com/go/open_options_uk</a>.
</p>
<p class="c5">2.6 Backup Copy. You may make a
reasonable number of backup copies of the Software, provided your
backup copies are not installed or used for other than archival
purposes.</p>
<p class="c5">2.7 Content Files. Unless stated
otherwise in the &ldquo;Read-Me&rdquo; files or other license
associated with the Content Files, which may include specific
rights and restrictions with respect to such materials, you may
display, modify, reproduce and distribute any of the Content Files.
However, you may not distribute the Content Files on a stand-alone
basis (i.e., in circumstances in which the Content Files constitute
the primary value of the product being distributed), and you may
not claim any trademark rights in the Content Files or derivative
works thereof.</p>
<p class="c5">2.8 Sample Application Code. You may
modify the source code form of those portions of such software
programs that are identified as sample code, sample application
code, or components (each, &ldquo;Sample Application
Code&rdquo;) in the accompanying Documentation solely for the
purposes of designing, developing and testing websites and
applications developed using Adobe software programs; provided,
however, you are permitted to copy and distribute the Sample
Application Code (modified or unmodified) only if all of the
following conditions are met: (1) you distribute the compiled
object Sample Application Code with your application; (2) you do
not include the Sample Application Code in any product or
application designed for website development; and (3) you do not
use the Adobe name, logos or other Adobe trademarks to market your
application. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Adobe
from and against any loss, damage, claims or lawsuits, including
attorney&rsquo;s fees, that arise or result from the use or
distribution of your application. You may be granted additional
rights to modify or distribute Adobe software code within
documentation relating to such code and/or the Software or in a
separate agreement between you and Adobe.</p>
<p class="c5">2.9 Programming Languages. The
Software may include the portions of the ExtendScript SDK and the
Pixel Bender SDK. Subject to the restrictions contained in this
Section 2, and the permissions contained in Section 2.8, Adobe
grants to you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license
to use the items in the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel Bender SDK only
for the purpose of internal development of application programs
designed to function with Adobe products.</p>
<p class="c5">Except as expressly provided in this
Section 2.9, no other portions of the ExtendScript SDK or the Pixel
Bender may be modified or distributed. You are required to include
Adobe&rsquo;s copyright notices on your application programs
except for those programs in which you include a copyright notice
reflecting another copyright ownership. You may not use

products.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c5">You agree to indemnify, hold
harmless and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage, claims
or lawsuits, including attorney&rsquo;s fees, that arise or
result from such distribution.</p>
<p class="c5">2.10 Dual Boot Platform. The
Software is licensed for use on a specific operating system
platform. You must purchase a separate license for use of the
Software on each operating system platform. By way of example, if
you desire to install the Software on both the Mac OS and Windows
operating system platforms on a device that runs both of those
platforms (i.e., a dual boot machine), then you must first obtain
two separate licenses for the Software. This is true even if two
versions of the Software, each designed for a different operating
system platform, are delivered to you on the same media.</p>
<p class="c5">2.11 Tryout Software. The Software,
or portions of the Software, may not require a serial number to
install or operate, for example, when configured to allow trial or
tryout for a limited period of time or for a limited number of
launches. You are not permitted to use the Software in a manner
inconsistent with its design or Documentation. For example, you may
not use the Software after its tryout period has ended unless you
input a valid serial number. ACCESS TO ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED
WITH THE SOFTWARE USED ON A TRYOUT OR TRIAL BASIS IS ENTIRELY AT
YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p class="c4"><b>3. Intellectual Property
Ownership.</b></p>
<p class="c5">The Software and any authorized
copies that you make are the intellectual property of and are owned

<p class="c4"><b>4. Restrictions and

include various applications, utilities and components, may support
multiple platforms and languages and may be provided to you on
multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the Software is
designed and provided to you as a single product to be used as a

transfer all your rights to use the Software to another individual
or legal entity provided that: (a) you also transfer (i) this

Licenses.</b></p>
<p class="c5">If you are a business, company, or
organization, you agree that, no more than once every 12 months,
Adobe or its authorized representative shall, upon 10
days&rsquo; prior notice to you, have the right to inspect your
records, systems, and facilities to verify that your use of any and
all Adobe software is in conformity with your valid licenses from
Adobe. If a verification discloses that your use is not in
conformity with a valid license, you shall immediately obtain valid
licenses to bring your use into conformity.</p>
<p class="c4"><b>14. Internet Connectivity and
Privacy.</b></p>
<p class="c5">14.1 Automatic Connections to the
Internet. The Software may cause your Computer to automatically
connect to the Internet and to communicate with an Adobe website
for purposes that may include providing you with additional
information, features and functionality. Unless otherwise specified
in Sections 14.2 through 14.6, the following provisions apply to
all automatic Internet connections by the Software:</p>
<p class="c5">14.1.1 When the Software
automatically connects to the Internet, an Internet protocol
address (&ldquo;IP&nbsp;Address&rdquo;) that is associated
with your current Internet connection is sent to an Adobe
website;</p>
<p class="c5">14.1.2 When the Software
automatically connects to the Internet, no personally identifiable
information is sent except to the extent that IP Addresses may be
considered personally identifiable in some jurisdictions;
and</p>
<p class="c5">14.1.3 Whenever the Software makes
an Internet connection and communicates with an Adobe website, the
Adobe Privacy Policy (<a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_uk">http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_uk</a>)
 shall apply. Additionally, unless you are provided with separate
terms of use at that time, the Adobe.com Terms of Use
(<a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/copyright_uk">http://www.adobe.com/go/copyright_uk</a>)
 shall apply. Please note that the Adobe Privacy Policy allows
tracking of website visits and it addresses in detail the topic of
tracking and use of cookies, web beacons and similar
devices.</p>
<p class="c5">14.2 Use of PDF Files. When you use
the Software to open a PDF file that has been enabled to display
ads through registration with the Ads for Adobe PDF
service,&nbsp;your Computer may connect&nbsp;to&nbsp;a website
operated by Adobe, an advertiser, or&nbsp;other third-party. In
addition to sending your IP Address, the party hosting the site may
use technology to send (or
&ldquo;serve&rdquo;)&nbsp;advertising or other electronic
content that appears in or near the opened file. The website
operator may also use JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action
tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to increase and
measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize
advertising content. Adobe may not have access to or control over
features that a third party may use, and the information practices
of third party websites are not covered by the Adobe
Privacy&nbsp;Policy.</p>
<p class="c5">14.3 Updating. The Software may cause your Computer to automatically connect
to the Internet to check for Updates that are available for
automatic download to your Computer and to let Adobe know the
Software is successfully installed. Please consult the
Documentation for information about changing default update
settings.</p>
<p class="c5">14.4 Use of Adobe Online Services.
The Software may use your Computer to automatically connect to the
Internet to facilitate your access to content and services that are
provided to you by Adobe as further described in Section 16.5. In
addition, your Software may automatically update downloadable
materials from these services so as to provide immediate
availability of these services even when you are offline. Please
consult the Documentation for information about changing default
update settings.</p>
<p class="c5">14.5 Digital Certificates. The
Software uses digital certificates to help you identify downloaded
files (e.g., applications and content) and the publishers of those
files. For example, Adobe AIR uses digital certificates to help you
identify the publisher of Adobe AIR applications and the Adobe
Acrobat family of products uses digital certificates to sign and
validate signatures within PDF documents and to validate certified
PDF documents. Your Computer may connect to the Internet at the
time of validation of a digital certificate.</p>
<p class="c5">14.6 Settings Manager. The Software
may include Flash Player. Flash Player may cause certain user
settings to be stored on your Computer as a local shared object.
These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to
configure certain settings within the Flash Player. You can find
more information on local shared objects at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_uk">http://www.adobe.com/go/flashplayer_security_uk</a>

</p>
<p class="c4"><b>15. Peer to Peer
Communications.</b></p>
<p class="c5">The Software may use your connection
to a local area network to automatically connect to other Adobe
software and, in doing so, may indicate on the local area network
that it is available for communication with other Adobe software.
These connections may transmit the IP Address of your connection to
the local network but no personally identifiable information is
ever transmitted or received through such network connections
(except to the extent that IP Addresses may be considered
personally identifiable in some jurisdictions). Please consult the
Documentation for information about changing default
settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c4"><b>16. Specific Provisions and
Exceptions.</b></p>
<p class="c5">This section sets forth specific
provisions related to certain products and components of the
Software as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and
conditions. To the extent that any provision in this section is in
conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, this
section will supersede such other term or condition.</p>
<p class="c5">16.1 No Prejudice, European Union
Provisions.</p>
<p class="c5">16.1.1 This agreement will not
prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those
dealing as consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who
obtain the Software for personal, domestic or household use (not
business purposes), this agreement is subject to the Consumer
Guarantees Act.</p>
<p class="c5">16.1.2 If you obtained the Software
in the European Union (EU), you usually reside in the EU and you
are a consumer (that is you use the Software for personal,
non-business related purposes), then Section 6 does not apply to
your purchase and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for
a period of 2 years from purchase that the Software provides the
functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the
&ldquo;agreed upon functionalities&rdquo;) when used on the
recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial variation from
the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty
rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE THAT YOU REQUEST
TO USE ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, PRODUCT SAMPLER BASIS, OR
TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS OR TO THE EXTENT THE
SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To
make a warranty claim, you must notify the Adobe Customer Support
Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of
purchase of the Software. Adobe will verify with you whether there
is a defect in the Software or advise you that the error arises
because you have not installed the Software correctly (in which
case, Adobe shall assist you). If there is a defect in the
Software, you may request from Adobe either a refund or a
repaired/replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be
accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event your warranty
details are substantiated, Adobe will meet your request for
repaired/replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for
Adobe to do so, in which case Adobe will provide you with a refund.
For warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe Customer Support
Department.</p>
<p class="c5">Please note that the provisions of
Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any
damages claims you make in respect of your use of the Software.
Nonetheless, Adobe shall be liable for direct losses that are
reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach by Adobe of this
agreement. You are advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid
and reduce damages, in particular by making back-up copies of the
Software and your computer data.</p>
<p class="c5">This agreement, and in particular,
this Section 16.1.2, is intended to describe your rights (including
your statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with
your use of the Software. If your statutory rights should be
greater than this description, your statutory rights shall
apply.</p>
<p class="c5">16.2 Pre-release Software Additional
Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software
(&ldquo;Pre-release Software&rdquo;), then this section
applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does
not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs,
errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures
and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release
Software. If you received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a
separate written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated
Serial Agreement for Unreleased Products, your use of the Software
is also governed by such agreement. You will return or destroy all
copies of Pre-release Software upon request by Adobe or upon
Adobe&rsquo;s commercial release of such Software. YOUR USE OF
PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR
WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN
PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</p>

and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may
be used only for your own customary internal business or personal
use and may not be distributed or transferred for any purpose,
except in accordance with Section 4.6 of this agreement.</p>
<p class="c5">16.4.5 You may embed copies of the
font software into your electronic documents for the purpose of
printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are
embedding is identified as &ldquo;licensed for editable
embedding&rdquo; on Adobe&rsquo;s website at
<a target="ADB-ESG" href=
